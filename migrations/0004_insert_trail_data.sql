    'The trail starts and ends at the picnic area. First, hike along the Yellow Medicine River Valley with high vistas and hillsides covered with native prairie. Look for red-tailed hawks gliding along with the air currents above the valley. The trail winds its way down into the valley along wooded slopes and around the high point of land where the river valleys meet. Follow the trail through the Minnesota River Valley and through hardwoods until you arrive at the picnic area. Look for the gnarled bur oaks which were likely the only trees on this hillside 150 years ago. ',

Then walk through a stone tunnel under the railroad tracks. After the tracks, hike into a finger of the hardwoods that juts down into the park. Look for luscious ferns and listen for the “beebzzz-bzzz-bzzz” of the golden-winged warbler. As you leave the woodlands, take a right on the Prairie Overlook Trail. Golden prairie grasses and a spectacular view of the St. Croix River Valley are your reward for making it to the top of the hill. Continue on the trail.
