On this hike, see examples of glacial till deposits — the highest in Minnesota. Also, watch for prairie wildlife.",

Climb a short section of rock and keep left up the hill to access the main loop where you’ll find a grassier trail with some steep sections. On the trail you’ll find several habitats typical of the park. This variety leads to a diversity of plants, animals, sights and sounds along the way. Water rushing over rock creates sounds of the river and Silver Creek. Dappled sunlight filters through maple, basswood and aspen trees highlighting forest ferns and wildflowers. Beaver activity created the large open meadow. The brilliant maple in fall, wolf signs in winter, spring wildflowers and summer birdsong make this trail interesting in all seasons. ",

The trail from the parking lot guides you around to the north east side of Pickerel Lake where you may be treated to the sights and sounds of loons or hear the slap of a beaver’s tail as you walk the shoreline of this small trout lake. A short spur trail of stairs leads down to a dock to access the lake. From the east side of the lake, travel up the hill and connect to the Big Hole trail while walking among impressive red and white pines. The hilly landscape also includes mixed stands of birch, aspen, maple, oak and balsam fir. From vantage points along the Big Hole Trail, you look down on a “kettle” pond of glacial origin. The loop trail returns you to the parking lot.",

Follow the self-guided interpretive trail as it wraps around the campground and descends to Hidden Falls, past the endangered Minnesota dwarf trout lily, a spring wildflower found only in Rice, Goodhue and Steele counties. Cross Prairie Creek and go uphill through the tall tree canopy and open understory of Beaver Trail. Turn onto White Oak Trail, crossing Oak Bridge. Look for the white oaks as you climb uphill. The trail turns east, crossing a bridge and walkway over ravines formed by melting glaciers more than 10,000 years ago. It concludes at the picnic parking area. In the spring, the park is carpeted with wildflowers; in summer, it’s a canopy of green. Fall brings a burst of red, orange and gold. In winter, look for ice formations at Hidden Falls.",
