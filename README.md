# MN Hiking Club

This is an idea my friend Dorothy had from her design bootcamp.  I'm trying to make it a reality.

## Tech Setup

This is based on the "standard starter" kit from RedwoodSDK. 

## Running the dev server

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Point your browser to the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/`).
